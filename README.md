# Portfolio

Portfolio project from Udacity's Front-End Developer Nanodegree. Given a designer's mockup as a basis idea, we had to build our own portfolio website.

## Issues Tackled

The project had responsiveness as its main focus. The website was designed and developed in such a way to make sure it works - and looks good - in all devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies and Strategies

To make sure the project would be responsive, I made use of **Flexbox**, **Media Queries**, **Breakpoints**, and **Minor Breakpoints**.

### Note

This was the very **first** website I built :)
